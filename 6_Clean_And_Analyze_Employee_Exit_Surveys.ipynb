    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guided project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey). We've made some slight modifications to these datasets to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to UTF-8 (the original ones are encoded using cp1252.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to combine the results for both surveys to answer these questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers. In the guided steps, we'll aim to do most of the data cleaning and get started analyzing these questions.\n"

    "Summary of the analysis is that\n",
    "- Suddenly, many people resigned in 2012 and 2013 (Any peculiar reason ?)\n",
    "- For DETE, more than 35% of the people resigned within the first 5 years of the service with the institute.\n",
    "- When we cateogorize employees into their tenure of service,it is observed that the `New` or slightlty `Experienced` category people are not that dissatisfied.\n",
    "- DETE has more dissatisfaction than TAFE, in some categories upto 60%\n",
    "- In the case of DETE, dissatisfaction among the employees increased as they spent more time with the institute, peaking at 7-11 years, and slightly decreased among the employees who spent more than 11 years; whereas for the TAFE institute, the situtation is more or less the same irrespective of the time spent with the institute. **These suggest that something is probably wrong with `DETE` than `TAFE`.**\n",
    "- Resigned employees are predominantly Female, almost 3.5x than Male. However, analysis by the gender suggested that in `DETE` in terms of percentages wise, `Female` employeess didn't resign more than `Male` employees because of dissatisfaction **suggesting the reason for dissatisfaction is not gender bias in the institute.**\n"
